## 1. Introduction

HireVibes is an crowdsourcing jobs Dapp that will empower.

People to:
1. Find jobs: With the help of the crowd via targeted and private referrals
2. Get paid: In cryptocurrency (and fiat tbc)
3. Earn more: A 5% bonus in HireVibe Tokens (HVT) on top of pay
4. Give back: Securely donate HVT to humanitarian and environmental initiatives with a HVT fund equivalent to 1% of their annual rate or salary

Individuals, teams, startups, businesses, non-profits and other decentralised communities to:
1. Hire: With the wisdom of the crowd by incentivised referrals
2. Pay: In cryptocurrency (and fiat tbc)
3. Reduce hiring costs: Using HireVibes Dapp platform costs half of the average price of using a centralised recruitment agency
4. Give back: Enable each new hire made to give back by donating HVT to humanitarian and environmental initiatives of their choice 

**HireVibes at a high level**

HireVibes will provide a "decentralised" community based alternative to the traditional ‘’centralised’’ recruitment agency business model. HireVibes Dapp will transform the hiring and jobs marketplace by:
 
1. Empowering crowdsourcing. HireVibes Dapp will incentivise the public crowd and niche talent communities to become the primary sourcing stream of candidates for job openings globally, which is known as crowdsourcing. When it comes to searching for someone or something, ten sets of eyes have a greater chance of finding that someone or something than any one individual pair of eyes can offer. With potentially thousands and millions of active users operating globally off a Decentralised application; HireVibes can offer a genuine synergy of sourcing ability waiting to be tapped into. 
2. Integrating giving back to the environment and humanitarian projects as a fixed component of each job fill made through the platform.
3. Harnessing the benefits and security of blockchain technology to transparently and efficiently operate a decentralised community-governed application.

**HireVibes at a more detailed level**
 
HireVibes Dapp will improve the core aspects of the ‘standard economic deal’ when applied to the hiring process: 

* **Search:** How jobseekers, referrers; start-ups, employers, orgs and DAC's find each other using the power of referrals and aligned incentives via crowdsourcing
* **Negotiations:** How jobseekers, referrers and start-ups, employers, orgs that use HireVibes Dapp to find a new job or a new hire will get a better deal overall compared to when using traditional centralised recruitment agency services
* **Performance:** How HireVibes will improve the candidate and hiring manager experience. HireVibes Dapp will become a home for the jobseeker where users can build their own personal data stores and control who has access to this information. 

On the employer side, HireVibes Dapp will be a one-stop hiring shop where a hirer can advertise for free, crowdsource candidates, manage CV applications, communicate in-app and later; hire and pay securely all from one single platform.

* **Post-performance incentive:** Each new hire will get rewarded with a 5% token reward in HireVibe Tokens (HVT), on top of pay, which contains a fixed 1% Donation Fund to support Humanitarian and Environmental initiatives and projects of the new hires’ choice using HireVibe Tokens.

## 2. HireVibes Mission
Humanity’s skills and energy or ‘HR’ could be channelled better to help clean the environment and create abundance for all that live on the planet. HireVibes Dapp aims to redirect the flow of wealth going to centralised agencies into a river of resources for people and the planet using cryptocurrencies, smart contract technology and swarm intelligence methodologies.
## 3. HireVibes Structure and Chosen Blockchain
HireVibes will be an open source crowdsourcing jobs Dapp on the EOS.IO software. HireVibes Dapp will be governed by the HireVibes Decentralised Autonomous Community (DAC) using HireVibe Tokens.
## 4. HireVibes Rewards Model 
HireVibes Dapp will do the core work that a centralised ‘recruitment’ agency or freelance marketplace would normally do: by connecting jobseekers with permanent, contract and freelance job opportunities worldwide based on their desired conditions. 

Upon successful hires, HireVibes Dapp will charge a small token amount of (7.5%) to the hirer / employer based on the salary, rate or total price of the job in question. 

However; following a certain period of time after the new hire begins his/ her job, HireVibes Dapp will automatically redistribute (5%) or (67% of the total 7.5% token amount) back to the successful candidate, broken down as follows;

A) If the user applied directly to the job ad at the beginning of the process:
* (4%) token reward is sent to the placed candidate in HireVibes tokens (HVT)
* (1%) donation fund is sent to the placed candidate for donating to Humanitarian and Environmental initiatives and eco-friendly projects of their choice using (HVT)

B) If the placed candidate was referred to the job ad at the beginning of the process:
* (2%) token reward is sent to the placed candidate in HireVibes tokens (HVT)
* (2%) token reward is sent to the referrer in HireVibes tokens (HVT)
* (1%) donation fund is sent to the placed candidate for donating to Humanitarian and Environmental initiatives and eco-friendly projects of their choice using (HVT)

## 5. Payment terms based on Job type
HireVibes Dapp will add in a lock-in period to all contracts made between a hirer and a candidate. Meaning; each successful candidate won’t receive their HVT token reward immediately. This reduces the risk of a candidate taking a job just so they can get their HVT reward and leave. Escrow services will also be in-built into freelance roles on HireVibes.

- Permanent roles = 30 Days lock-in period, paid in 3 instalments
  * When start date is activated, an invoice will be automatically generated and issued to the ‘client’. The client has 30 days to pay this invoice. When a client pays within 30 days, only 50% is paid to successful candidate at the 30 day point, the remaining will be held in escrow by HireVibes Dapp.
  * When a candidate reaches 60 days in the jobs, the next 25% will be released
  * When a candidate reaches 90 days, the last 25% will be released to the candidate

- Contract roles (contracts over 30 days) = 15 Days lock-in period, paid in 3 instalments
   * When start date is activated, an invoice will be automatically generated and issued to the ‘client’. The client has 15 days to pay this invoice. When a client pays within 15 days, only 50% is paid to successful candidate at the 15 day point, the remaining will be held in escrow by HireVibes Dapp.
  * When a candidate reaches 30 days into the contract, the next 25% will be released
  * When a candidate reaches 45 days into the contract, the last 25% will be released to the candidate
  
-  Freelance roles (contracts less than 30 days)= 7 days lock in period, paid in 1 instalment

Meaning when a Freelancer starts a freelance role they found on HireVibes; that user will receive their 5% HVT reward 7 days after start date.

## 6. Value Proposition 

By financially and ethically incentivising the crowd to source candidates (which is a form of ‘crowdsourcing’) with a 5% reward; HireVibes will attract a larger quantity and higher quality of direct and referred CV applications to open job ad’s, making it easier for hirers to consistently make the right hires in an efficient and cost-effective way that generates highly positive PR for their employer brand.

When it comes to sourcing technical IT talent for example; the technical talent themselves are the best people to find other technical talent because they are the domain experts in this field and these people know the job spec and the required profile better than anyone else. So by outsourcing the ‘sourcing’ to the crowd, employers will gain access to a wider network of domain experts to source the talent they are looking for.

Enabling users to earn a cryptocurrency token reward when finding a new job for themselves or their peers, while also making a positive and quantifiable contribution to the environment; both combined, create positive experiences and good vibes for the jobseeker, the hirer and the community at large. 

## 7. Hiring Manager Experience and Benefits
Here are the main advantages of using HireVibes DAC for sourcing and hiring talent:
* **Free to advertise job ad’s on HireVibes.io** 
This is a risk-free solution as hirers only pay for results i.e. when a hire is made – which is the opposite to paying for a traditional job board listing up front and then ‘praying’ for good suitable applications to arrive.
* **Reduced cost**
The cost of using HireVibes Dapp is a 7.5% token amount upon successful hires if no add-on service is selected. This is half the cost compared to the 15% industry average fee on permanent jobs, and much less than half of the 25% average fee charged by centralised agencies on contract jobs.
* **Public referrals campaign**
This creates a new brand engagement stream for the Employer. HireVibes turns the public crowd into brand ambassadors by economically and environmentally incentivising referrals.
* **High quality hires**
Mean higher quality hires and research shows that referred candidates stay in the job longer on average.
* **Positive PR** 
The 1% Donation fund (equivalent to 1% of the annual salary / rate in question) creates positive PR and CSR to promote each Employer’s Brand
* **Happy and engaged new starters** 
By receiving a token reward that includes a donation a certain number of days after start date, the new hire will be happier and more engaged which will massively reduce the risk of the new starter leaving. The token reward will act as a loyalty incentive and will overall produce a happy user experience for the candidate 
* **Branded Advertisements**
This removes the secrecy around what the ‘client’ is so the employer brand will receive a lot more traffic and exposure to the talent market

## 8. Employer Branding: Merging Hiring and CSR
Employer branding is the key activity to every successful long term hiring strategy. 

Having a strong employer brand adds value to an employer's job offers and services to external candidates and clients. Given the increasing competition for talent; branding has become progressively more vital for finding and retaining the best candidates. 

HireVibes will be an Employer Branding platform aswel as a hiring platform. By implementing ‘giving back’ as part of the hiring process will enhance the image and reputation of companies, start-ups and decentralised organisations etc that advertise on HireVibes. 

These organisations that actively demonstrate their values and commitment to caring for the environment will have a competitive advantage in the hiring marketplace over those who don’t. It shows these org’s are serious about their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and that they are aligned to the values and desires of modern day people and the millennial age group specifically, who are becoming the largest majority of the labour market and they want to work for more than just money.

## 9. Donation Tracking 
All recipients of donations will be required to provide proof of how the donation was spent as part of the smart contract agreement. 

## 10. Growth Model 
The quantity of Job Openings listed on HireVibes Dapp will grow overtime due to:

1. Hirer Referral Reward Proposal 
- A one-off 2% HVT reward to every user that refers a Hirer that successfully recruits on HireVibes Dapp ([Hirer Referral Reward](hirer-referral-reward.md))
2. Inbound marketing 
- The Candidate Referrals Rewards on offer are a natural way to attract new users to HireVibes Dapp
- Showing statistics and content of the HireVibes Donation portal impact across social media
3. Growing a Decentralised Recruiting Team 
- Please see below

## Decentralised Recruiting Team (DRT) (Similar to a Customer Service Team)

### **1.Why?**
Originally we stated in HireVibes whitepaper; we stated that we (the HireVibes Launch Team) were envisaging the HireVibes DAC or HV Foundation would grow a team of Recruitment Facilitators to be listed and available to facilitate any Hirer’s needs on HireVibes Dapp.

Freelancer.com for example have an option to help Hirers with recruiting the best candidates for an extra fee. HireVibes Dapp will offer a similar service as some Hirers will require it.

However, as our team that are building the HireVibes Dapp open source software are decentralisation enthusiasts; we were concerned at the potential of the Recruitment Facilitator Team becoming a centralised function; within the overall decentralised HireVibes and EOS.IO ecosystem. 

For this reason, we are going to design and built this **Decentralised Recruiting Team** into the HireVibes Dapp open source software from the very beginning. With that, we have also created a Quality Control System to ensure the quality of the DRT service increases overtime.

### **2. Hiring Recruitment Facilitators**

* Any and all users interested to become a Recruitment Facilitator on HireVibes Dapp can sign up and become one by agreeing to all the terms and conditions and Constitutions of HireVibes Dapp and EOS.IO software.
* All Recruitment Facilitators will have an open profile and be Reputation based. As all users must agree to all EOS.IO and HV constitutions, terms and conditions; good behaviour can be expected. For any bad behaviour and dispute resolution, HireVibes Dapp users can utilise the built-in EOS Arbitration system.

### **3. Matching Hirers with Recruitment Facilitators:**
* HireVibes Dapp will provide an option to all Hirers when posting job ads asking if they would like to engage the services of a Recruitment Facilitator for an added 2.5% token amount. (Bringing the total cost to a 10% token amount)
* If a facilitation service is required, HireVibes Dapp will automatically choose the best Recruitment Facilitator based on reviews, areas of specialism etc and present this to the Hirer. An advanced option will also become available to enable a Hirer to choose their preferred Recruitment Facilitator manually.

### **4. Recruitment Facilitator Tasks**

1. Find new Hirer’s, communicate the HireVibes value proposition and encourage them to join HireVibes Dapp and post new jobs openings 
2. Offer a Facilitation Service where required for added 2.5% token amount (Recruitment Facilitators will get 2%, the remaining 0.5% token amount will go to a smart contract to fund the Quality Control System explained below)
3. If engaged to provide a Facilitation Service, a Recruiter listed on HireVibes Dapp may be asked to:
- Screen applicant CV’s 
- Provide a shortlist of the best suited candidates and why
- Source externally of HireVibes Dapp (However all applications must be submitted within HireVibes Dapp)
- Check references 
- Offer negotiation 
- Follow up with new hires to ensure the placed candidate have a smooth onboarding 

 ### **5. Ensuring the Quality of Recruitment Facilitators rises overtime**

As this system would be very open; we have designed a Quality Control system to be implemented to HireVibes Dapp once it launches. 

1. This system is designed to ensure a gradual rise in the quality of all Recruitment Facilitators service on HireVibes Dapp overtime, without any central party managing it.
2. This system will also ensure that the best Recruitment Facilitators on HireVibes Dapp get recognition and rewarded by the community.
3. Elements of this has been inspired by ‘Lunyr’ - which is an Ethereum based equivalent of Everipedia which is launching on EOS. Their model ensures a consistent rise in the quality of Reviewers who Peer Review articles overtime (https://www.lunyr.com/) 
4. The HireVibes model contains layers of gamification to incentivise the Decentralised Recruiting Team to self-regulate, grow organically and improve in quality overtime.

### **6. Decentralised Recruitment Team -  Quality Control System + Growth model**

1. **Model structure**

- The first 100 Recruitment Facilitators to facilitate 10 hires on HireVibes DAPP will automatically be elected as Lead Recruiters
Lead Recruiters will provide a Screening Function to the application process that’s open to all Recruitment Facilitators to apply to be listed on HireVibes Dapp.
- When the 100 Lead Recruiters are elected, at this stage, any user can still apply to be a Recruitment Facilitator on the HireVibes Dapp, but each applicant must pass a screening process led by the Lead Recruiters to get listed.
- The Lead recruiters must interview and screen new Recruitment Facilitators who want to be added to the HV Dapp and propose a hire is made to the Lead Recruiting team
- It will be mandatory that at least 3 other Lead Recruiters must review, vote and reach consensus on hiring each new Recruitment Facilitator before they join HireVibes Dapp

2. **Funding the Decentralised Recruiting Team and Quality Control system**

- When posting a job ad, hirers can select and pay for a Recruitment Facilitator service for an added 2.5% token amount if they require this extra service. This will bring the total cost to the Hirer to a 10% token amount based on the salary or rate on offer.
- Out of this 2.5% token amount; Recruitment Facilitators get rewarded a 2% token amount upon successes, the remaining 0.5% token amount will go to a smart contract to fund the Quality Control System.
- For every new Recruitment Facilitator hired by the Lead Recruiting team; the Lead Recruiter responsible will get rewarded a 0.5% token amount per addition.
- This means that the DRT and the Quality Control system to accompany it; can be funded by itself, grow organically and it won’t need to rely on HireVibes DAC to fund it.
- All Recruitment Facilitators will join a ‘league table’ whereby the best Recruiters (ones with best reputations and most job fills) will be known and respected by the HireVibes community (DAC)
- These two rewards (recognition rewards and token rewards) will further encourage competition among all the Recruiters to improve their performances and the quality of their service.   
- The Recruiters at the top of the league table will be seen as huge contributors as they will have helped generate large amounts of resources for qualified charities and initiatives. This will be visible to all HireVibes Dapp users.

3. **Replacing Lead Recruiters**

- There will be a monthly or quarterly voting process whereby all HV token holders (HV DAC) can propose and vote in new Lead Recruiters to HireVibes Dapp. 
- Only Recruiters that have filled 10 jobs can qualify to be elected as a Lead Recruiter on HireVibes Dapp.

4. **Quality Control Tools for Recruitment Facilitators**

- The Recruiters listed on HireVibes Dapp could utilise a CRM tool and agree to maintain it themselves.
- This should be a simple Customer Relationship Management tool that would help prevent Recruitment Facilitators contacting the same potential Hirer multiple times.
- The HireVibes Launch team may build one or source a suitable CRM for the DRT to use.


## 11. Marketing Strategy
Outbound marketing: The HireVibe Recruiter team will be tasked with adding new jobs and Employers to HireVibes Dapp. This team will be like a global sales / customer service team who will:

1. Pitch HireVibes cost effective service to new hirers to advertise their job vacancies on HireVibes Dapp
* Upsell to facilitate the hiring process for an extra (2.5% - 5%) fee
* Share Job ad’s across social media to generate attention and CV applications
* Source externally of HireVibes if needed but submitting all CV’s through the HireVibes Dapp with consent of the candidate.
2. Inbound marketing via: 
* By simply having open and live job ads on our platform will naturally attract new jobseekers and referrers to the HireVibes.io website
* Contextual content marketing via blogging and social media
* Announcing new affiliate partnerships: including new Environmental and Humanitarian Initiatives and new employers that join HireVibes Dapp
* Show a live counter covering statistics of the crypto rewards earned by jobseekers and referrers on HireVibes Dapp and the subsequent stream of donations that followed from it
* Referral Marketing: The core referrals mechanism of HireVibes will naturally drive new jobseekers and thus new employers to HireVibes DAPP.

## 12. Positive Impact Projections <small>(generated from HireVibes Dapp Donation portal)</small>
These are estimated spin-off projections based off of the projected HireVibe Recruiters’ Target KPI’s (This is still to be decided and will be announced prior to HV Dapp launching.)

Using [WeForst.org](http://weforst.org) (who can plant 1 tree for 1 euro) as a beneficiary of the 1% donation fund (using euro as an example)

| 1. Recruiter        | Weekly           | Monthly  | Annually  |  
| ------------- |-------------:| -----:|-----:|
| Hires facilitated| 1.25 | 5 | 60 |
| Donations Value @1% per hire (€500 per €50K salary)|€625|€2,500|€30,000|
| No of Trees planted @ €1|625|2500| 30,000|
|100 HV Recruiters| 62,500 | 250,000 |3,000,000|

`= 1 HireVibe Recruiter can help plant 500 trees per week and 30,000 per year.`

Using WellsForZoe as a beneficiary of the 1% donation fund (who can construct a well in East Aftrica for €250 to provide water to 300 people for life) 

| 1. Recruiter        | Weekly           | Monthly  | Annually  |  
| ------------- |-------------:| -----:|-----:|
|Donations Value @1% per hire (€500)|€625|€2,500|€30,000|
|No of wells built @ €250|2.5|10| 120 |
|X 300 people benefited per well| 750 | 3,000 | 36,000|

So:

* A team of 100 HireVibe Recruiters could potentially help provide water for life to 75,000 people per week, 300,000 people per month, 3.6 million+ people potentially per year.
* @10,000 recruiters (Close to a top 5 recruitment agency Size) Using WellsForZoe model = 360 million people annually would be guaranteed water for life.

## 13. Primary Target Market

The Hiring and recruitment market is growing annually at circa 12% - 20%. The HireVibe Recruiting team may initially focus on IT and Blockchain related jobs globally as IT related talent and startups, DAC’s etc will most likely be the early adopters HireVibes Dapp.

In 2016, the global staffing market generated 428 billion US dollars of revenue and is expected to grow 5% in 2018 (Staffingindustry.com).

Penetrating the rest of the professional hiring markets like: Finance, Sales and Marketing, Multilingual etc will be HireVibe Recruiter’s team second goal.

## 16. HireVibes DAC Governance Layer Proposal
This is a governance layer we are exploring implementing to the HireVibes DAC. HireVibes DAC will also be subject to the EOS.IO governance and arbitration systems at all times.

The HireVibes Governance model, managed by HV token holders, will be the backbone to the long term success of this organisation. The governance model employed by HireVibes DAC will iterate and evolve overtime as the DAC grows. 

Dispute Resolution (TBC): 

Aspects of the dispute resolution model will be based on the Brehon Law law system. 

Brehon Law is a polycentric legal system which means that the laws are actually created by the people themselves. This stateless legal system operated in Ireland for over 3,000 years. It has been proven to be one of the most used and harmonious law systems to be integrated by people all around planet Earth. Brehon Law is similar in its core to most indigenous law systems as seen from tribes in the Amazon to the aboriginal people of Australia, to the Native American Indians to the ancient Irish people.

The common traits of the same Law model seem to naturally emerge as the primal governance model when people are left alone to organise themselves without any interference from centralised or monarchical authorities.

Some of the main governance features that could be integrated to HireVibes DAC Governance Layer include:

* An open Arbitrator application process: meaning anyone can apply to be an arbitrator on HireVibes DAC and earn HVC tokens for finding harmonious outcomes to disputes that happen on the network. The most qualified Arbitrators with the best reputations will be the most selected and used
* Each arbitrator must add a certain % to the pot of each case as surety that the right decision will be made.
* Restorative Justice; meaning the arbitrator aims to find a harmonic solution for both parties, not just the victim
* Compensatory justice: Every ‘lapse in one’s own honour’ (bad action) can be resolved with paying a level of fair compensation
* Meritocracy: Titles aren’t given to people, they are earned by action and merit
* Full disclosure: All previous disputes rulings will remain open to community inspection whereby if at any time a better solution is found that should have been implemented; then a proposal can be made for a new transaction to be made to implement the new better solution as voted by the community. 

## 17. HireVibes Foundation (TBC)
The HireVibes Foundation (A GMBH not for profit entity that’s in the process of being established in Switzerland) will be a service provider and legal interface for HireVibes DAC. 

This Foundation will be directed by HireVibes DAC and it will also be transparent to the HireVibes DAC by reporting monthly activity.

The HireVibes Foundation’s goals will be to promote and assist the research and development of decentralised solutions that generate harmony and clear value for people and the planet.  

The Foundation will distribute use any excess income over expenditure to worthy causes while also using it to expand the Foundations’ service provision capabilities to HireVibes DAC

One of the HireVibes Foundations new initiatives we are planning to create is to implement volunteering recruitment and skill-sharing matching to HireVibes DAPP (free of charge)

HireVibes Foundation may partner with 3rd party providers for providing exchange services between Fiat and cryptocurrency to hirers and candidates. This will be announced prior to launching.
